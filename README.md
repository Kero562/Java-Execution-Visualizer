# Java-Execution-Visualizer

An unfinished Visual Studio Code extension and a Java agent that work together to visualize Java code execution in real-time. This tool modifies Java bytecode at runtime to inject print statements indicating which line of your code is being executed. The VS Code extension listens for these print statements and highlights the corresponding line in your editor. More debugging features to be added to make it ACTUALLY useful.
